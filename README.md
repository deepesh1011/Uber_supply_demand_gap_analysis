## Problem Statement:
![Analysis Presentaiton file-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40337495/63208633-42fde700-c0f4-11e9-904a-01bcef7f5baa.jpg)

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

* [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have tool to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook.](http://ipython.org/index.html)
Make sure you use Python 3.If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Intalling Anaconda Python
The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook as well as NumPy, Pandas,matplotlib is to start with the Anaconda Python distribution.
Follow the installation instructions to download the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python. We recommend using Python 3.7.

git clone https://github.com/mrdeepeshkumar/Uber_supply_demand_gap_analysis Use cd to navigate into the top directory of the repo on your machine

Launch Jupyter by entering

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser. 
## Download the data 
Before running the notebook, you'll first need to download all data we'll be using.This data is located in Uber Request Data_Set.csv file of  Uber_supply_demand_gap_analysis directory.

## Objective:

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.
